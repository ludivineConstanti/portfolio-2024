# üìã User Testing Feedback

I went through a round of user testing and improved the website based on the results.

## üéØ Adding the website‚Äôs goal

One user reported that she was confused about the purpose of the website, and only understood it after scrolling down and seeing the Work Experience section. Since the hero section of the website only included my name, my role, and the fact that I create websites, it was not enough to give a clear idea of the website content. To solve this, I added the fact that this is my portfolio in the text of the hero section.

## üîΩ Scroll down CTA

Some users were confused about what they should do when first arriving on the website. One said that she was not sure if she should scroll or rather swipe to the side. I realized that the bottom navigation, which allows you to navigate between the different sections of the page, could be confused for the dots that appear at the bottom of image sliders. I therefore added text, that instructs the user to scroll down, and I animated it for it to bounce up and down, to make sure it catches the user‚Äôs attention.

## ‚û°Ô∏è See project CTA

Since the general feedback was to make the element‚Äôs role clearer, I decided to also add text to the project links CTA. Before, the arrow and the reaction on hover were the only hints that it was an interactive element. Now it lets the user know he/she can see the project by clicking on it.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Using the website's image as a link

While using the website and looking at the Heavens of Mankind project page, a user tried to click on the image, to see the live version of the website. I did not think about the fact that the image could be confused for a link, but it is an intuitive thought, especially on mobile where the image is smaller. I modified the element so that it links, either to the live version of the website, to its GitHub repository, or its Study Case. I then added a text CTA on top of it, which makes users aware that there‚Äôs a link, and lets them know where it leads. I think it‚Äôs a good way to highlight the main link of the project. I left the Links section, inside of the project page, the original place where this link was, since it‚Äôs good practice to give multiple ways to perform the same action from the user (and there‚Äôs also the possibility to display multiple links if a website has a live version, a public GitHub repository, and a Study Case).
