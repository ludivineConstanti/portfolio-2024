# ‚ú® Creating a new portfolio

## üï∞Ô∏è Previous concept

[My first portfolio as a developer](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/portfolio-2021) only had 3 projects in it. I created it after doing a Full Stack programming BootCamp and I knew I would only have a limited amount of time to create projects, so the size would be quite small. I also chose to not add any project I worked on as an Art Director in it, since I was afraid people would focus on them, and not the skills I gained as a developer (since I would have 3 projects related to development and 15 related to design).

Its structure was very simple: a landing page with a button that leads to 1 of the projects and a menu with 4 links (the home page and the 3 projects). This was great at the time, and successfully helped me to get a job, but does not corresponds to my new needs. After working multiple years as a developer, I now have a lot more projects I can show. I also wanted to add links to articles in it, since I've heard that it's difficult to understand what I've done on the project, just by looking at them. Now that I gained more professional experience as a developer, and have a lot more projects to show, I feel more confident to include the previous work I did as an Art Director, which increases the number of projects.

Since my new portfolio does not have much in common with the previous one, it made no sense to try to update it. Especially since I wanted to use a new tech-stack. I therefore started a new one from scratch.

## ‚úÖ Requirements for my new portfolio

### üóÇÔ∏è Plenty of projects

Since I have a lot more projects to show, I want to be able to put all of them in my portfolio. But since I am aware very few people will have the time to look at all of them, I also want to communicate clearly which projects are the most relevant. For this, I want to use 2 systems:

#### üìÜ Ordering by date

Since the most recent projects are the most relevant, I want to order them by date, with the most recent ones at the top. By adding the year, I also want to show my progression by including projects that are very old and no longer reflect my current skills.

#### üí™Ordering by skills

Not every skill I gained is relevant to my portfolio's users. But since I am quite open-minded in the fields I want to work in, I am not sure which ones are relevant or not. To solve this, I got inspired by LinkedIn with their skill badges. I decided to add them to each projects, to make it clear which tech-stack or skill was used during it, and later add a filter system which would help users find the projects they are interested in.

I think the skill badges are also a great opportunity to communicate my level on the skills that I feature. I've heard a lot of criticism about candidates who show a progress bar on skills like TypeScript and Figma (since it doesn't mean much). I think being able to see in how many projects I used the tech-stack/software/skill that I am talking about help giving an idea of how often I use it during my work, and therefore the familiarity that I have with it.

### üì∞ Plenty of articles

Over the years, I wrote some articles to document my learning journey. I heard that it's quite interesting to read, since it helps people understand my role in the project (and which parts were challenging). Those articles are unfortunately difficult to find, since they're inside of [multiple GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti), as well as on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ludivine.constanti) and [Hashnode](https://ludivine-constanti.hashnode.dev/). Regrouping them in one place makes things easier.

### üóÇÔ∏è Highlight projects & articles

Since most people will not want to go through all of my projects, I need a way to highlight a few of them. I therefore decided to add a section with a sample of projects on the home page. The same applies to articles.

### üöº Realistic MVP

Personal projects are very hard to finish, especially if you need to do the concept and design by yourself. I decided to have a minimal version, which would show the projects and articles, and then add features once it is ready (generating a PDF for my resume, adding a filter, adding a client and an award section, a sub-menu for navigation, meta pages...).

### ‚û°Ô∏è Fast updates

To be able to keep my portfolio up to date, I need low requirements to add new projects and articles. This means that the project page needs to be kept minimalistic: the more images and custom requirements it has (custom animation...), the harder it is to update regularly. I therefore decided to have only 1 image per project, 1 description and then the links to the projects. It's also convenient for me to store links this way, since it's hard to remember years after, what was the link of the website of the articles, awards that it got.
