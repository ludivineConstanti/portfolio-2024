              I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer who loves working remotely (in

              My journey in the digital world started in 2017 as an Art
              Director, which gave me a solid product & goal oriented mindset. I
              love when my work produces real value.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the skill set gained from my past professional experiences
              helps me to have a positive impact on the product I work on,
              (notably for UI/UX mindset, clear priority setting, adaptability &
              workflow organization), I want to focus on improving my skills on
              automation, Architecture, Back End & AI.

              Born with the INTP (Logician) personality type, I consider life as
              a long learning journey. This is why I switched countries multiple
              times (learning a few languages along the way) while switching
              job-titles in the Design & Technology industry.

              <br />
              I love when I am able to work with team members with diversified
              backgrounds, as I found out that it is a great opportunity to
              learn & teach at the same time. Alternating between beginner &
              expert mindset is great to build empathy, keep learning while
              making sure we write code that is understandable for all levels.

              Since a young age, I have always had a long term mindset, in favor
              of taking calculated risks. This is a perfect combination with
              learning. While each new learning experience requires risks, they
              are always rewarding.

              Whenever faced with a concept or problem (be it for code or human
              relationships) I love to be able to understand its full concept.
              This is why I prefer long term projects or teams where I can learn
              more about my team members.
              <br />
              <br />
              I believe that true learning can only be achieved by staying in
              touch with the world, through information gathering. This makes me
              happy to receive feedback & have an open communication culture. Be
              it by accessing data, analytics on the project or communication
              with other teams (sales, customer success...).
              <br />
              <br />
              This is important since while gathering data helps, knowing how to
              correctly interpret it is often the trickiest part. I can perform
              my best when goals and priorities are set clearly. I also love to
              spend one (or more) months (s) to level up a specific skill.
              <br />
              <br />
              My favorite part of the SCRUM framework is the retro with the
              team, to reflect & improve our work.
